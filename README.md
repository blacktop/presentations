# presentations

## Getting Started

### [blacktop.github.io/presentations](https://blacktop.github.io/presentations/)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** I attempted to utilize the Keynote.app's export to HTML feature, but it seems to have created files too big for most browsers to handle.  

So to view the animations you can view locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blacktop/presentations.git
cd presentations
open index.html
```

Or via the PDF *(without the awesome animations üòî)*
